# lita-puppet


Impersonate Lita and send message to other rooms. Since we made haste for ourselves, there are not any error handling etc.

* To send the message, Lita must be invited.

## Installation

Add lita-puppet to your Lita instance's Gemfile:

``` ruby
gem "lita-puppet", github: "katsumata-ryo/lita-puppet"
```

## Usage

```
To Lita > puppet <room_name> <message>
```
